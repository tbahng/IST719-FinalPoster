# IST719-FinalPoster
Final project for course IST719

The objective of this project is a culmination of course learnings to create an academic research poster board.

Content follows graphic design principles concerning color, typeface, and layout.
The visualizations/plots are primarily created using R, and then Adobe Illustrator is used for creating the final poster.

About the data:
The data set is an index of historical figures from Wikipedia. 
It was created from the Pantheon Project, developed by the Macro Connections group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab. 
The download is available from https://www.kaggle.com/mit/pantheon-project. 
Each observation represents a historical figure for whom there are 17 attributes, including a historical popularity index.

Code is provided for plot and insight reproducibility.

Posters can support the "3 distances" (across the room appeal, middle distance topic overview, up close detail).

Layout and other visual elements support a visual hierarchy that enables quick navigation.

Sections are clearly outlined for different areas:
- data description
- areas for the two important plots
- questions and motivation

Requirements:
- Your name and class (IST 719) clear on poster (can include a photo of you)
- Poster is minimum 24 x 36 to max 36 x 48. Poster can be portrait or landscape mode.
- Presentation: practiced and delivered within instructor specified timeframe
- Poster Story: Two sentences that provide overall context for the poster. In addition a meaningful poster title.
- Motivation: 2 or 3 sentences that answer these questions: 1) who might be interested in this (audience); 2) why might they be interested? Ideally, this text leads to your questions (next item).
- Questions: between 2 and 3 questions (with question mark) that can only be answered by relating two or more fields of data.
- Data description text: 2 or 3 sentences that includes number of rows and columns, what the data is about and note subsetting, cleaning, and aggregations.
- Sources: data source, R packages, R scripts, any templates, vector or raster images (small clip art, icons and small bits of code are excluded). Include link when possible.
- Data descriptive plots: 2 to 4 single dimension plots that show the data distributions. Uses appropriate data encoding. Used R to make plot. These plots don't answer your questions. They provide insight into your dataset and help provide depth to your overall data story.
- Key visualization: the main plot. Must be 2 or more dimensions showing a relationship that answers one of your questions. Uses appropriate data encoding. Use R to make plot. Should be in its own sub-heading area on poster with a relevant title.
- Supporting Visualization(s): one or two additional multi dimension visualizations that answer your other questions. Uses appropriate data encoding. Used R to make plot. Should be in its own sub-heading area on poster with a relevant title.
- Color: consistent, appropriate, appealing
- Layout and use of space: good alignment, space for eye to rest, good navigation clues, not crowded
- Image Quality: vector graphics or high resolution supporting images
- Good overall design. Has WOW factor.
- Files uploaded: 
	- Your original Adobe Illustrator file
	- A pdf of the poster, 
	- All R script(s) that load data, do some data prep work, and make your plots. 
	- DO NOT INCLUDE THE DATA (but the poster should give me enough information that I could download it if I wanted). 
	- Files should be uploaded before live session 11.
